A Community Based Open Software Project

We are developing a Chat Messaging application using SwiftUI with contributions majorly from the attendees of [Swift Mumbai Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Mumbai/).

If you are enthusiastic about -
- Learning to build fairly large iOS apps
- Using SwiftUI to build complex real time Messaging / Chat apps
- Learn about Server Side components, building Frameworks / SDKs, expand into watchOS / macOS / WebAssembly
- Learn skills off Developers in the Community
- Teach your skills & knowhow to the Community

Then feel free to get start asap by -
- Attending Swift Mumbai Meetups [In-Person](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Mumbai/) or [Online](https://www.twitch.tv/techstreams)
- [Building features](https://github.com/swiftmumbai/chatkit/projects/1)
- [Resolving bugs](https://github.com/swiftmumbai/chatkit/issues)
- [Reviewing Pull Requests](https://github.com/swiftmumbai/chatkit/pulls)
- [Designing App Flow & Screens](https://github.com/swiftmumbai/chatkit/tree/master/Assets)

If you can attend In-Person Swift Mumbai Meetups, we regularly have [Code Along Sessions](https://www.meetup.com/SwiftMumbai/events/265116292/) where - 
1. You'll be assigned a Task Ticket for this Project
2. A Task Ticket should take approximately 45 minutes of programming to complete
3. You raise Pull Request to merge your code to Master Repository
4. That's it. Now be proud of your Open Source contribution. ðŸŽ‰

If you can only attend Online, checkout our regular Twitch Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/techstreams
