A Community Based Open Software Project

We are developing a Chat Messaging application using SwiftUI with contributions majorly from the attendees of [Swift Mumbai Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Mumbai/).

If you are enthusiastic about -
- Learning to build fairly large iOS apps
- Using SwiftUI to build complex real time Messaging / Chat apps
- Learn about Server Side components, building Frameworks / SDKs, expand into watchOS / macOS / WebAssembly
- Learn skills off Developers in the Community
- Teach your skills & knowhow to the Community
